# Summary Report: AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1 – AI/ML & Generative AI on AWS  

### Event Objectives  

- Help participants grasp the core concepts behind Generative AI and how AWS services support modern AI and ML workloads.  
- Introduce foundational models and showcase how **Amazon Bedrock** can be used to build real-world AI-powered applications.  
- Give students and developers practical exposure to **prompt engineering**, **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** patterns, and scalable AI solution architectures.  
- Encourage active participation through interactive segments, including a Kahoot quiz to review knowledge in a fun way.  

### Speakers  

- **Dinh Le Hoang Anh** – Cloud Engineer Trainee, First Cloud AI Journey  
- **Lam Tuan Kiet** – Senior DevOps Engineer, FPT Software  
- **Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi** – AI Engineer, Renova Cloud  

### Key Highlights  

- Introductory session on **Generative AI fundamentals**, covering how large language models work and how AWS positions these capabilities within its cloud ecosystem.  
- In-depth explanation of building **production-ready AI agents**, including orchestration and workflow management using **Amazon Bedrock** and its agent features.  
- Focused segment on **prompt engineering best practices**, techniques to guide model behavior, and strategies to minimize hallucinations in model responses.  
- Detailed walkthrough of **RAG pipelines**, from data ingestion and embedding creation to integrating vector databases for context-aware question answering.  
- Live demos of real use cases, such as intelligent chatbots and visual/semantic search, showing how Bedrock and other AWS services can be combined in end-to-end solutions.  
- Strong audience participation, with more than 200 students and AWS Cloud Club members contributing to a dynamic and collaborative atmosphere.  
- A closing **Kahoot quiz** session to reinforce the main ideas, check understanding, and keep the energy high until the end.  

### Key Takeaways  

- **Amazon Bedrock** is a powerful foundation for designing, deploying, and scaling Generative AI applications without having to manage underlying model infrastructure.  
- Turning a small prototype into a reliable production system requires **well-designed workflows**: agent orchestration, retrieval layers, evaluation, and continuous improvement.  
- The quality of prompts, the relevance of retrieved context, and effective use of **vector search** play a major role in reducing hallucinations and improving AI output accuracy.  
- The broader **AWS AI/ML ecosystem** lowers the barrier to entry, enabling developers from various backgrounds to experiment, build, and iterate on AI solutions more easily.  

### Event Experience  

- The event gathered a large, enthusiastic group of learners and practitioners, creating an environment where participants could look at Generative AI from both conceptual and practical perspectives.  
- Clear explanations of how foundational models function—combined with demos in Amazon Bedrock—made it easier to see how these technologies can be integrated into real applications.  
- Hands-on examples, such as chatbot workflows and document summarization scenarios, helped bridge the gap between high-level theory and day-to-day implementation.  
- Engagement stayed high throughout the session, and the Kahoot mini-game at the end gave everyone a playful but effective way to review and confirm what they had learned.  
- Overall, the event provided a balanced mix of **technical depth, real-world use cases, and interactive learning**, making it especially valuable for students and aspiring AI builders taking their first serious steps into Generative AI on AWS.
