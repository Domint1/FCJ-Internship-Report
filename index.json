Determining player skill today is difficult due to the vast array of metrics games record (such as hits, misses, assists, time played, level, and more), making it challenging to determine which factors are most indicative of skill. Instead of manually creating algorithms to determine player skill, machine learning (ML) techniques (particularly supervised learning) can automatically identify patterns across game metrics to produce more accurate skill ratings. These ML-derived ratings enable more balanced matchmaking, ultimately enhancing player satisfaction and engagement.\nIn this first part of our two-part blog series, we\u0026rsquo;ll show you how to use Amazon SageMaker AI to quickly build and deploy an automated ML pipeline. Amazon SageMaker AI provides the capabilities to build, train, and deploy ML and foundation models, with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows. The model and pipeline we build will produce a value that is a more reflective and precise rating of each player\u0026rsquo;s skill.\nTo accomplish this task, we will be building upon the Guidance for AI-Driven Player Insights on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The architecture diagram for the guidance shows how game studios can leverage this low-code solution to quickly build, train, and deploy high-quality models that predict player skill using historic player data. Operators just upload their historic player data to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). This invokes a complete workflow to extract insights, select algorithms, tune hyperparameters, evaluate models, and deploy the best performing model for your dataset to a prediction API orchestrated by Amazon SageMaker Pipelines.\n*Figure 1: Architecture diagram of the Guidance for AI-Driven Player Insights on AWS.* Figure 2 shows the architecture you will be implementing in this blog. The diagram shows the flow of how a player\u0026rsquo;s matchmaking request is handled. The matchmaking request triggers Amazon API Gateway, invoking an AWS Lambda function which receives the relevant player data from Amazon DynamoDB. The data is then passed to the Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint, which runs an inference to produce the more holistic skill value used by Amazon GameLift FlexMatch in the matchmaking process.\n*Figure 2: Matchmaking workflow using matchmaking simulator.* The following architecture diagram shows how you will implement this solution in an actual game by connecting FlexMatch to an Amazon GameLift Servers queue. This triggers GameLift Servers to place or spin up game servers for the newly created matches.\n*Figure 3: Matchmaking workflow as part of a game backend.* Walkthrough: Prerequisites Before starting, you should have the following prerequisites:\nAn AWS account with IAM permissions (administrative access) to create and use a SageMaker AI Domain.\nA code editor.\nTo download the data file you will be using for this tutorial, choose PlayerStats.csv on the GitHub repository and select the \u0026ldquo;Download raw file\u0026rdquo; option, as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4: PlayerStats.csv download page.\nOptional: If you would like to replace the code files we will be modifying throughout this tutorial rather than modifying the code line by line, choose the following links to download each of the files using the \u0026ldquo;Download raw file\u0026rdquo; option:\nworkflow.py evaluation.py skill_inference.py The prerequisites found in the Guidance for AI-driven player insights on AWS GitHub repository.\nSetting up SageMaker AI domain Open the SageMaker AI console. Under the left side menu, choose Domains. Choose Create domain. Figure 5: Amazon SageMaker domain dashboard. Select the Quick Setup option and choose Set up. Figure 6: Amazon SageMaker domain creation. Access the Amazon SageMaker Studio dashboard Select the domain you created in the previous section. Figure 7: Amazon SageMaker domain selection.\nUnder the User profiles section, select the Launch dropdown button located next to the profile you want to use. Select SageMaker Studio which will open in another tab. Leave this tab open, we will be coming back to this in a later section. Figure 8: Domain user profiles.\nDeploying the AI-driven player insights solution Follow the deployment steps provided by the AWS AI-Driven Player Insights repository linked in the prerequisites section of this blog. You will need to deploy the solution using your own device if you do not have access to an AWS Cloud9 development environment. Follow the Deployment Steps up to Step 5 within the guide.\nUnderstanding AI-driven player insights on AWS Traditionally, developing effective machine learning models requires data science experience since builders must determine appropriate data pre-processing methods based on metric relationships, select optimal machine learning algorithms, and establish model performance evaluation strategies. With this solution, you will no longer need extensive machine learning experience to build and deploy machine learning models. Instead, you will leverage the feature Amazon SageMaker Autopilot.\nAmazon SageMaker Autopilot automates the complete process of building, training, tuning, and deploying machine learning models. Amazon SageMaker Autopilot analyzes your data, selects algorithms suitable for your problem type, and preprocesses the data for training. It also handles automatic model training and performs hyper-parameter optimization to find the best performing model for your dataset. To accelerate the process of training and deploying machine learning models as data changes over time, our solution provides a pre-defined machine learning pipeline. The pipeline triggers the entire process and model deployment from the moment your data is uploaded to your S3 bucket.\nThis solution requires a player statistics dataset. The dataset should include relevant performance metrics for your game and the current skill rating used for matchmaking. For this tutorial, we will use the PlayerStats.csv file you downloaded in the prerequisites section.\nPreparing the machine learning pipeline for linear regression The AI-driven player insights machine learning pipeline, by default, is configured for predicting player churn with an output of \u0026ldquo;True\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;False\u0026rdquo;. Since the output value for this example refers to categorical data with discrete outcomes, this is set up for a classification problem. In our tutorial, we are looking to output numeric data for a player\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Skill\u0026rdquo;. Since we are looking at supervised learning for numeric data with continuous outcomes, we need to modify this pipeline for linear regression, the most common supervised learning model for predicting numeric data.\nIn your preferred code editor, open the /player-insights/constants.py file and replace its contents with the following (Be sure to replace the values for SM_DOMAIN_ID and REGION to your own specific values.):\nWORKLOAD_NAME = \u0026#34;PlayerSkills\u0026#34; REGION = \u0026#34;[YOUR REGION]\u0026#34; SM_DOMAIN_ID = \u0026#34;[YOUR SAGEMAKER AI DOMAIN ID]\u0026#34; DATA_FILE = \u0026#34;PlayerStats.csv\u0026#34; TARGET_ATTRIBUTE = \u0026#34;playerSkill\u0026#34; PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD = 0.00 ENDPOINT_TYPE = \u0026#34;SERVERLESS\u0026#34; Since we will be training a linear regression model, we will need to change the evaluation to Mean Squared Error (MSE). Replace the /player-insights/evaluation.py main function with the following code:\nif __name__ == \u0026#34;__main__\u0026#34;: logger.debug(\u0026#34;Starting Evaluation ...\u0026#34;) logger.info(\u0026#34;Reading Test Predictions\u0026#34;) y_pred_path = \u0026#34;/opt/ml/processing/input/predictions/x_test.csv.out\u0026#34; y_pred = pd.read_csv(y_pred_path, header=None).squeeze() logger.info(\u0026#34;Reading Test Labels\u0026#34;) y_true_path = \u0026#34;/opt/ml/processing/input/true_labels/y_test.csv\u0026#34; y_true = pd.read_csv(y_true_path, header=None).squeeze() mse = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred) logger.info(f\u0026#34;Mean Squared Error: {mse}\u0026#34;) report_dict = { \u0026#34;regression_metrics\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;mean_squared_error\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: mse, \u0026#34;standard_deviation\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NaN\u0026#34;, }, }, } output_dir = \u0026#34;/opt/ml/processing/evaluation\u0026#34; pathlib.Path(output_dir).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) evaluation_path = os.path.join(output_dir, \u0026#34;evaluation_metrics.json\u0026#34;) logger.info(\u0026#34;Saving Evaluation Report\u0026#34;) with open(evaluation_path, \u0026#34;w\u0026#34;) as f: f.write(json.dumps(report_dict)) Open the /player-insights/workflow.py file. Here we are adjusting the machine learning pipeline to use the MSE metric for evaluation rather than the F1 score (since F1 score is used for classification problems). To do this, we will modify the failure step defined around line 227 to send a message indicating the MSE is less than the specified threshold.\nfailure_step = FailStep( name=\u0026#34;ModelEvaluationFailure\u0026#34;, error_message=Join( on=\u0026#34; \u0026#34;, values=[\u0026#34;Pipeline execution failure: MSE is less than the specified Evaluation Threshold\u0026#34;] ) ) You will also need to modify the conditional step defined around line 259 in this same file to use the MSE metric for evaluation instead of the weighted F1 score.\nconditional_step = ConditionStep( name=\u0026#34;ModelQualityCondition\u0026#34;, conditions=[ ConditionGreaterThanOrEqualTo( left=JsonGet( step_name=evaluation_step.name, property_file=evaluation_report, json_path=\u0026#34;regression_metrics.mean_squared_error.value\u0026#34; ), right=metric_threshold ) ], if_steps=[step_register_model, deployment_step], else_steps=[failure_step] ) Verify that the cloud development kit (CDK) deployment correctly synthesizes the proper AWS CloudFormation templates to ensure your changes are updated in the stack by executing the following command in your terminal: cdk synth\nDeploy your modified solution by executing the following command in your terminal: cdk deploy\nLocate the S3 bucket created by the CloudFormation template by opening the AWS CloudFormation console. Choose the PlayerSkills-Stack. Figure 9: CloudFormation stack.\nOn the right side of your console screen, you will see a tab labeled Outputs. Select the Outputs tab and take note of the value for the key DataBucketName. Figure 10: CloudFormation stack outputs.\nOpen the Amazon S3 console and choose the bucket that has the name you noted in the previous step. Choose Upload. Figure 11: Amazon S3 object upload.\nChoose Add files, choose the CSV file you downloaded in the prerequisites, and choose Upload. This will trigger your machine learning pipeline to begin. Training and model deployment will take roughly 30 minutes to be completed. Figure 12: Amazon S3 object upload – adding files.\nChecking pipeline completion progress Navigate back to the tab you have with the SageMaker Studio page open. Within the left side menu, choose Pipelines. Figure 13: Amazon SageMaker Studio home page.\nChoose the PlayerSkills-AutoMLPipeline and choose your most recent execution. Figure 14: Amazon SageMaker pipeline. Figure 15: Amazon SageMaker pipeline executions.\nAfter the execution is completed, you will see a graph showing the steps of the pipeline and their results. Figure 16: Amazon SageMaker pipeline execution details graph.\nTesting your machine learning model Once training and model deployment is completed successfully, there is an Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint that will be created. Locate the Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint by navigating to Amazon SageMaker in the AWS Management Console. On the left side menu, under the Inference section, choose the Endpoints option. The name of the endpoint in this tutorial is PlayerSkills-Endpoint. Note the name of your created endpoint, you will be referring to this later. Figure 17: Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint.\nTo test the newly created model and endpoint, you can replace lines 23-25 in the /player-insights/assets/examples/churn_inference.py file with the following code:\nresponse = predictor.predict( \u0026#34;10597,20312,602,205,1916,56266,76578,9725,8.0\u0026#34; ).decode(\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;) Rename the file churn_inference.py to skill_inference.py.\nTo run the script, in your command line, navigate to the /player-insights/assets/examples directory and run the script with the following commands:\ncd assets/examples python3 skill_inference.py --endpoint-name PlayerSkills-Endpoint If the script runs successfully, it will return a response that is a value between 0-1 of the endpoint\u0026rsquo;s output. Changing the values entered in the previous step will change the output values.\nCleaning up resources You\u0026rsquo;ll be using what you deployed in this blog in the second part of this series, so we won\u0026rsquo;t clean this up yet. We\u0026rsquo;ll show you how to clean up any resources you\u0026rsquo;ve deployed in the next blog.\nIn the second part of this series, we\u0026rsquo;ll show you how to use the newly determined \u0026ldquo;Skill\u0026rdquo; value in conjunction with Amazon GameLift FlexMatch. Amazon GameLift FlexMatch will handle the logic of matchmaking players while giving you, the developer, a way to adjust which matches are created through a rules-based syntax called FlexMatch rule sets.\nConclusion We showed how to deploy a solution for AI-driven player insights on AWS, and how to build an ML model to more holistically infer a player\u0026rsquo;s Skill value. Based on what makes a player skillful within your game, you can choose what in-game factors that the ML model uses to determine player skill. This results in a more precise player skill that you can use to create balanced and competitive matches.\nBe certain to join us again for Implementing AI-Powered Matchmaking with Amazon GameLift FlexMatch, the second blog in this series. We\u0026rsquo;ll show you how to use the results from this blog\u0026rsquo;s model to match players using Amazon GameLift FlexMatch. You will also learn how to simulate matchmaking using the Amazon GameLift Testing Toolkit in order to test both the ML model and your matchmaking parameters.\n"},{"uri":"https://domint1.github.io/FCJ-Internship-Report/3-blogstranslated/3.2-blog2/","title":"Blog 2","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Tracing ETL Workloads using AWS X-Ray and AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry by Praneeth Reddy Tekula, Deepak Kovvuri, and Viveyk Karri on 30 APR 2025 in AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry, AWS Glue, AWS X-Ray, Management Tools, Technical How-to Permalink Share\nIntroduction Data pipelines are essential for modern data-driven companies to gain critical business insights. However, data pipelines commonly fail when new files or datasets from data sources do not conform to the expected schema, leading to downstream job failures, workflow breakdowns, and delayed insights. Additionally, fluctuating data volumes, from a few gigabytes to multiple terabytes, can significantly impact the efficiency and reliability of these pipelines. This can make it challenging for customers to identify the specific ETL job within the data pipeline that failed.\nTo address these challenges, monitoring data pipelines in real-time and maintaining an end-to-end view is critical to identify issues early and minimize disruptions. In this blog post, we will explore how to orchestrate an end-to-end ETL pipeline using AWS Glue, AWS Step Functions, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) and AWS X-ray.\nSolution overview This solution addresses a data engineering use case with two-phase pipeline approach: –\nData Cleaning: The data cleaning phase is handled by an ETL job to convert arbitrary data formats (CSV, JSON) to Parquet and performs various transformations, including standardizing column names, dropping unnecessary columns, removing duplicates, filling null values, converting data types, fixing skewness in certain columns. Data Processing: Next, the data processing phase is handled by another ETL job that calculates, ranks and groups data. The data pipeline is orchestrated end to end using AWS Step Functions, leveraging AWS Glue for ETL jobs that are instrumented with ADOT and custom X-ray helper model for comprehensive tracing. Figure (1) illustrates architectural components involved in the orchestration of an end-to-end ETL pipeline. Here’s how it works: –\nUpload a dataset, to the S3 bucket by creating a folder input. This triggers lambda function, that starts a new X-Ray trace and invokes Step Function workflow by passing traceID and S3 object details as an input. Step Function workflow passes this traceID as a parameter. Glue Jobs use X-ray helper module to retrieve the parent segment for the current job, and correlate with input traceID from step functions. Glue Job – 1 fetches input data set from S3 bucket to perform data cleaning and uploads the output to the same bucket by creating a folder clean. After completion of Glue Job -1, step function workflow triggers Glue Job – 2. Glue Job – 2 fetches input data set from S3 bucket to perform data processing job and uploads the output to the same bucket by creating a folder processed. Each Glue Job is instrumented with ADOT, to send collected trace data to OpenTelemetry Collector that is running as a sidecar on ECS. OpenTelemetry Collector then pushes collected trace data to AWS X-Ray. Figure 1: Solution Architecture\nBy leveraging this solution, we maintain a single trace across the entire ETL pipeline that provides end to end visibility into the data processing workflow. Data engineers and MLOps professionals can gain deep insights, quickly identify bottlenecks or failures, and optimize their data processing workflows for improved efficiency and reliability.\nPrerequisites To deploy this solution, you need:\nAn AWS account. If you don’t already have an AWS account, you can create one. An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that launches AWS CloudFormation templates which creates IAM roles to access services such as AWS Glue, AWS X-Ray, AWS Step Functions, AWS Lambda, Amazon ECS, AWS CloudMap and Amazon Simple Storage Service. Install AWS CLI. Python 3.12 or later Install AWS CDK. Deploy the Solution with AWS CDK We will use AWS CDK to deploy the solution. CDK allows defining the infrastructure through a familiar programming language such as Python.\nClone the repository. git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/tracing-etl-workloads-otel.git cd tracing-etl-workloads-otel Create and activate a virtual environment: For Linux and macOS. python3 \\-m venv .venv source .venv/bin/activate For Windows. python \\-m venv .venv .venv\\\\Scripts\\\\activate Install dependencies. pip install \\-r requirements.txt Bootstrap the CDK environment (if not already done). cdk bootstrap Deploy the stack. cdk deploy This will create all the necessary resources, including S3 buckets, Glue jobs, Step Functions state machine, and Lambda function. Once, the solution is deployed, on your AWS CloudFormation console, you can find the deployed resources on the “OtelSolutionStack” CloudFormation stack resource section.\nWalk-through of the solution Upload Airbnb sample dataset to the S3 ingestion bucket under input prefix folder.\nFigure 2: Sample dataset uploaded to S3 bucket\nWait for the AWS StepFunction state machine workflow to succeed.\nFigure 3: State machine workflow running Glue jobs\nNavigate to AWS CloudWatch console. Click on the “Xray traces” in left navigation pane and select the recent traceID.\nFigure 4: Trace retrieval on AWS X-ray\nA trace map is displayed by default. It is a visual, end-to-end representation of data flow through each component within the data pipeline Figure 5: Trace Map, an end to end representation of data flow.\nEach component i.e., AWS Lambda, AWS Step Function, and AWS Glue will create its own segment within the trace. Figure 6: Segments in a trace\nYou will see sub-segments under AWS Glue Segment because of the instrumentation done using AWS Distro for Open Telemetry. Figure 7: Sub-segments in AWS Glue Segment\nFigure 7: Sub-segments in AWS Glue Segment\nThis level of detail allows data engineers to identify which specific operation in a glue job is taking the most time.\nDetailed Explanation of Trace Correlation The solution uses a custom X-Ray helper module to correlate traces across the ETL pipeline. Here’s how it works\nGlue Jobs:\nAt the start of each Glue job, X-Ray helper module is used to retrieve the parent segment for the current job:\nxray_trace = xray_helper.XRayTrace(TRACE_ID) parent_id = xray_trace.retrieve_segment_for_step(JOB_NAME) If a parent segment is found, a new ADOT context is created using the X-Ray propagator:\ncarrier = {\u0026#39;X-Amzn-Trace-Id\u0026#39;: f\u0026#34;Root={xray_trace.trace_id};Parent={parent_id};Sampled=1\u0026#34;} propagator = AwsXRayPropagator() context = propagator.extract(carrier=carrier) The Glue job execution is wrapped in a span using this context:\nwith tracer.start_as_current_span(\u0026#34;Glue Job Execution\u0026#34;, context=context, kind=trace.SpanKind.SERVER): # Job execution code Throughout the job, individual operations are wrapped in spans for detailed tracing:\nwith tracer.start_as_current_span(\u0026#34;Read Data\u0026#34;, attributes={\u0026#39;S3Path\u0026#39;: s3_path}): # Read data operation Trace Emission:\nThe ADOT instrumentation is configured to send trace data to the OpenTelemetry Collector running as a sidecar. The OpenTelemetry Collector then forwards the trace data to AWS X-Ray. processor = BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint=f\u0026#34;http://{OTLP_ENDPOINT}:4318/v1/traces\u0026#34;)) tracer_provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource, active_span_processor=processor) By using this approach, we maintain a single trace across the entire ETL pipeline, from the initial S3 upload trigger through the Step Functions execution and individual Glue job runs.\nUnderstanding Distributed Tracing Concepts It’s important to understand some key concepts in distributed tracing:\nTraces: A trace represents the entire journey of a request or operation as it moves through a distributed system. In our ETL pipeline, a trace begins when data is uploaded to S3 and ends when the final processed data is written to Amazon S3. Spans: Spans are the building blocks of a trace. Each span represents a unit of work or operation within the trace. For example, in our Glue jobs, we create spans for operations like “Read Data”, “Drop Columns”, or “Calculate Minimum Total Spend”. Spans have a start time, end time, and can include additional metadata like logs or tags. Example from our Glue job: with tracer.start_as_current_span(\u0026#34;Calculate Minimum Total Spend\u0026#34;): spark_df = spark_df.withColumn(\u0026#34;minimum_total_spend\u0026#34;, (col(\u0026#34;price\u0026#34;) + col(\u0026#34;service_fee\u0026#34;)) * col(\u0026#39;minimum_nights\u0026#39;)) Parent-Child Relationships: Spans can have parent-child relationships, creating a hierarchical structure within a trace. In our solution, the overall Glue job execution is a parent span, while individual operations within the job are child spans.\nSegments: In AWS X-Ray, a segment is similar to a span, but represents a unit of work done by a single component in your application. In our case, each Lambda invocation, Step Functions execution, and Glue job run creates a segment.\nSubsegments: These are equivalent to child spans. They represent smaller units of work within a segment. In our Glue jobs, the individual operations we trace become subsegments in X-Ray.\nTrace Context Propagation: To maintain a single trace across different components of a distributed system, we need to propagate the trace context. This is what allows us to link the Lambda function, Step Functions execution, and Glue jobs into a single trace. We do this by passing the trace ID and parent segment ID between components. Example of propagating context in our Glue job:\ncarrier = {\u0026#39;X-Amzn-Trace-Id\u0026#39;: f\u0026#34;Root={xray_trace.trace_id};Parent={parent_id};Sampled=1\u0026#34;} propagator = AwsXRayPropagator() context = propagator.extract(carrier=carrier) Attributes and Annotations: These are key-value pairs that provide additional context to spans or segments. We use these to add useful information like S3 paths, job names, or data statistics. Example from our code: with tracer.start_as_current_span(\u0026#34;Glue Job Execution\u0026#34;, context=context, kind=trace.SpanKind.SERVER, attributes={\u0026#39;job_name\u0026#39;: JOB_NAME, \u0026#39;job_run_id\u0026#39;: JOB_RUN_ID}) Sampling: In high-volume systems, it’s often impractical to trace every single request. Sampling is the practice of only tracing a subset of requests. AWS X-Ray provides configurable sampling rules to control how much data you collect and store. OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration A key component in our tracing setup is the OpenTelemetry Collector, which runs as a sidecar alongside Glue jobs. The collector is responsible for receiving trace data from our instrumented Glue jobs and forwarding it to AWS X-Ray.\nLet’s break down the configuration file (otel-agent-config.yaml) that defines how the collector operates.\nReceivers: The collector is configured to receive OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) data via both gRPC (port 4317) and HTTP (port 4318). This allows our Glue jobs to send trace data using either protocol. Exporters: The awsxray exporter is configured to send the collected trace data to AWS X-Ray. This is how our trace data ultimately ends up in X-Ray for visualization and analysis. Processors: A memory limiter processor is configured to prevent the collector from consuming too much memory. It’s set to limit memory usage to 100 MiB and check every 5 seconds. receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317 http: endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318 exporters: awsxray: region: us-east-2 processors: memory_limiter: limit_mib: 100 check_interval: 5s service: pipelines: traces: processors: - memory_limiter receivers: - otlp exporters: - awsxray This OpenTelemetry Collector configuration ensures the effective capture, processing, and export of trace data to AWS X-Ray for visibility and analysis of our data processing pipelines\nClean up You can either delete the stack through the CloudFormation console or use AWS CDK destroy from the root folder.\ncdk destroy When deleting a stack, most resources will be deleted upon stack deletion, however that’s not the case for all resources. In this solution, lambda functions will generate Amazon CloudWatch logs that are retained even after stack deletion. These won’t be tracked by CloudFormation because they’re not part of the stack, so the logs will persist. Follow steps here, to manually delete any logs that you don’t want to retain from CloudWatch console.\nConclusion This solution provides an end-to-end observability view of a data pipeline workflow by propagating context and tracing individual operations through AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry and AWS X-Ray. This enables data engineers to quickly troubleshoot failures, optimize performance, and gain insights into how data characteristics impact downstream processing. Such observability is crucial for modern data platforms involving complex, distributed workflows across multiple components and services.\n"},{"uri":"https://domint1.github.io/FCJ-Internship-Report/3-blogstranslated/3.3-blog3/","title":"Blog 3","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The AWS Imagine Grant launches the 2025 cycle in six countries, expanding its global reach By: Jeff Kratz Date: March 26, 2025 Source: AWS Public Sector Blog\nToday, Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched the 2025 AWS Imagine Grant cycle in six countries.

Introduce and explain advanced security controls such as Service Control Policies (SCPs), permission boundaries, MFA, and IAM Access Analyzer in real-world scenarios. Walk attendees through a realistic identity lifecycle demo: onboarding users, assigning permissions, and configuring SSO using the console and AWS CLI. Speakers Van Hoang Kha – AWS Community Builder Cloud Club Captains from HCMUTE, HUFLIT \u0026amp; PTIT Dinh Le Hoang Anh – Cloud Engineer Trainee, First Cloud AI Journey Huynh Hoang Long – Cloud Engineer Trainee, First Cloud AI Journey Key Highlights Clear comparison between IAM and IAM Identity Center: responsibilities, design patterns, and how they support different organizational scales and structures. Practical breakdown of SSO workflows, showing how central identity providers and AWS accounts connect to give users one place to sign in and access multiple environments. In-depth explanation of SCPs and permission boundaries, including examples of how to set guardrails at the organization level while still enabling teams to manage their own permissions safely. Hands-on walkthrough of enabling MFA, using IAM Access Analyzer to detect risky permissions, and rotating access keys safely without downtime. Live demo showing how to onboard a new user into IAM Identity Center, assign them accounts and permission sets, and test SSO access from both the console and AWS CLI. High-level overview of the AWS security lifecycle that connects identity, logging \u0026amp; detection, infrastructure protection, data security, incident handling, and application-level controls. Key Takeaways Identity is the first layer of defense in AWS: using IAM Identity Center for centralized access management makes multi-account environments easier and safer to manage. SCPs define what is allowed or disallowed at the organization level, while permission boundaries constrain what individual IAM roles/users can do — together they provide strong governance and safer delegation. MFA, regular access reviews, and continuous permission analysis are non-negotiable practices to reduce the risk of compromised credentials. Services like AWS CloudTrail, Amazon GuardDuty, and AWS Security Hub provide the visibility and detection needed to spot suspicious activities and respond quickly. A robust security architecture is layered: network controls, encryption, least-privilege access, secure configurations, and automated remediation all reinforce each other. Secure software delivery requires integrating security into the CI/CD pipeline, protecting secrets, scanning code and images, and monitoring applications at runtime. Event Experience The session presented AWS security in a structured, step-by-step way: starting with identity foundations, then adding advanced controls, and finally connecting them to the full security lifecycle. The overview of the Well-Architected Security Pillar helped tie many services together into a clear narrative, instead of treating each tool as an isolated feature. The live demo was especially valuable: watching the full flow of creating users, assigning permission sets, enabling SSO, and testing access made the concepts much easier to remember and apply. Overall, the event gave a realistic picture of what it takes to secure AWS environments at scale — particularly for organizations adopting multi-account setups and aiming for strong governance without blocking developer productivity.

Amazon Cognito is AWS’s fully managed identity service that provides:\nUser sign-up \u0026amp; sign-in (email/password, social logins, SAML/OIDC) Built-in email/phone verification Multi-factor authentication (MFA) User directory with custom attributes and groups Secure JWT tokens (ID token, access token, refresh token) Scales automatically to millions of users Free tier: 50,000 monthly active users In this workshop, we use Cognito User Pools as our secure backend identity provider.\nWhat is AWS Amplify (Gen 2 / v6+)? AWS Amplify is the official AWS toolkit for frontend and mobile developers.\nThe new Amplify Gen 2 library (v6+) released in 2024–2025 is completely rewritten and is now:\nTree-shakable (only import what you use) Fully SSR-compatible (ssr: true) Designed specifically for Next.js App Router \u0026amp; React Server Components No more @aws-amplify/ui-react or Hosted UI required Uses the new modular @aws-amplify/auth, @aws-amplify/datastore, etc. We will use only the Auth category of Amplify Gen 2 — the cleanest, most secure, and most modern way to connect a Next.js app to Cognito.\nWhy Use Cognito + Amplify Gen 2 Together in 2025? Benefit Explanation Rapid \u0026amp; Secure Development Amplify abstracts all token handling, refresh logic, and Cognito API calls SSR \u0026amp; App Router Ready Works perfectly with ssr: true → no hydration errors, no window is not defined No Client Secret Public SPA client (no secret needed) → safe for Next.js \u0026amp; Vercel Production-Grade Security Tokens never touch localStorage on server, automatic refresh, secure by default Role-Based Access Uses Cognito Groups → cognito:groups in ID token → easy admin/user detection Deploy Anywhere Works flawlessly on Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify Hosting, CloudFront + S3 Future-Proof This is the official AWS-recommended pattern from 2024 onward What You Will Build (Exact Outcome) A complete Next.js 14 (App Router) application with:\nSign-up → automatic email verification code Sign-in → protected dashboard Global AuthContext + useAuth() hook ProtectedRoute component Clean, modern UI using shadcn/ui Zero security anti-patterns Ready?

Executive Summary Rafilm is a Letterboxd-inspired movie logging and recommendation platform designed to help general users track their watched films, share reviews, and discover new favorites through AI-powered recommendations. Built as part of the AWS First Cloud Journey (FCJ) internship, Rafilm integrates Amazon Personalize and Bedrock to deliver tailored movie suggestions and conversational recommendations via a chatbot interface.\nThe platform runs fully on AWS Serverless architecture, featuring Amplify-hosted Next.js frontend, Lambda-based backend services connected through API Gateway, and DynamoDB for scalable user and movie data storage. TMDb provides external movie data integration, while Amazon Cognito manages user authentication. Rafilm aims to demonstrate a scalable, intelligent, and cost-efficient architecture capable of supporting multi-user access and interactive experiences.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? While existing movie platforms like Letterboxd and IMDb offer robust logging and social features, they lack personalized recommendation systems and interactive discovery experiences. Users often rely on external sources or generic trending lists to find what to watch next, leading to irrelevant or repetitive suggestions.\nThe Solution Rafilm integrates a custom recommendation pipeline powered by Amazon Personalize, combined with a Bedrock LLM chatbot that interprets user preferences and generates conversational movie recommendations. Users can log movies, write reviews, and receive curated suggestions—all within one seamless experience. Unlike Letterboxd, Rafilm focuses on data-driven personalization and AI-assisted interaction rather than pure social networking.\nBenefits and Return on Investment By leveraging AWS Serverless services, Rafilm achieves near-zero maintenance cost, pay-per-use scalability, and real-time AI-driven personalization. For the FCJ internship, the project serves as both a technical showcase and a learning artifact for integrating AI services in serverless architectures. Projected cost remains under $1/month during testing, with AWS Free Tier coverage for most usage.\n3. Solution Architecture Rafilm employs a modular serverless architecture using AWS services for scalability, integration, and cost optimization.\nAWS Services Used AWS Amplify: Hosts the Next.js frontend for movie browsing, logging, and chatbot interaction. Amazon Cognito: Handles user registration, login, and session management. Amazon API Gateway: Routes client requests to backend Lambda functions. AWS Lambda: Executes serverless business logic (e.g., CRUD for reviews, fetching TMDb data, triggering recommendations). Amazon DynamoDB: Stores user logs, movie interactions, and preferences. Amazon Personalize: Trains and serves personalized recommendation models. Amazon Bedrock: Provides conversational chatbot functionality for recommendation dialogue. Amazon S3: Stores static assets and backups for logs and model outputs. Component Design Frontend (Next.js): User-friendly interface for movie discovery, logging, and chat-based recommendations. Backend (Lambda + API Gateway): Stateless logic layer handling user operations, movie fetching, and recommendation retrieval. Data Layer (DynamoDB + S3): Stores structured user interactions and movie metadata for model training. AI Layer (Personalize + Bedrock): Personalize analyzes historical user interactions; Bedrock chatbot provides natural language access to personalized results. Authentication (Cognito): Securely manages multi-user access. Architecture Overview Users log in via Cognito and interact with the Next.js interface. Actions such as logging or rating trigger API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB workflows. The Bedrock chatbot accesses Personalize results to generate conversational movie suggestions. Amplify hosts the frontend for seamless deployment and scalability. 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases Architecture Design (Month 1): Research AWS serverless and AI integration patterns; finalize architecture diagrams. Prototype Integration (Month 2): Implement Amplify hosting, Cognito authentication, and Lambda-based backend APIs. Recommendation System (Month 3): Connect Personalize and Bedrock for end-to-end AI recommendation and chatbot response. Testing \u0026amp; Deployment: Conduct functional testing, optimize costs, and deploy production-ready version on Amplify. Technical Requirements Frontend: Next.js + React hosted via AWS Amplify, using TMDb API for movie data. Backend: AWS Lambda (Node.js runtime) connected through API Gateway. Database: Amazon DynamoDB for scalable user and review data. AI Components: Amazon Personalize (user-item recommendations) and Bedrock (chatbot dialogue). Authentication: Amazon Cognito for secure, multi-user access. Automation: AWS SDK \u0026amp; CloudFormation for provisioning; AWS SAM for deployment workflows. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Phase Duration Key Deliverables Month 1 Research \u0026amp; Architecture AWS design finalizing Month 2 Core Development Amplify hosting, Cognito setup, Lambda API, DynamoDB schema Month 3 AI Integration \u0026amp; Testing Personalize training, Bedrock chatbot, system deployment Post-Launch Continuous Improvement Cost optimization, new features, UX refinement 6. Budget Estimation Estimated Monthly Cost: $40.09 USD ($481.08 for 12 months)\nThe cost estimate of this project is projected in this link: https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=dab7fb57dabfb76041cdba98ac2bac7ba9630046\nThe monthly cost estimate of $40.09 USD is calculated based on the following specific usage assumptions derived from the AWS Pricing Calculator:\nStandard Usage: Assumes 10,000 requests per month for both AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. User Base: Assumes a maximum of 10,000 Monthly Active Users (MAU) for Amazon Cognito. AI/ML Usage (Primary Cost Driver): Amazon Bedrock is estimated for continuous operation (24 hours per day) with an average of 1 request per minute and 100 input/output tokens per request. Amazon Personalize includes 1 GB of data ingested and 15 training hours per month. Security Overhead: Assumes use of 1 AWS WAF Web ACL with 4 Rules and 3 Managed Rule Groups. Data Storage: Assumes 0.5 GB of data storage in Amazon DynamoDB. 7. Risk Assessment Risk Probability Impact Mitigation API rate limits from TMDb Medium Medium Cache requests via Lambda Model training cost escalation Low Medium Use limited training dataset for testing Chatbot latency Medium Low Optimize Bedrock model type and response size Authentication or token expiry Medium Low Use short-lived JWTs and refresh tokens 8. Expected Outcomes Technical Improvements Demonstrates serverless integration of AI/ML and LLM services in real-world use. Establishes a reusable AWS architecture for recommendation-based apps. Long-Term Value Provides a foundation for future expansion into a social movie discovery network. Serves as an AWS FCJ internship showcase project highlighting scalability, personalization, and conversational AI.

You will learn why traditional skill formulas struggle with large, diverse gameplay metrics, and how supervised learning can automatically identify which factors best represent true player skill. The article walks you through setting up a SageMaker AI domain, preparing a regression-based pipeline with Autopilot, deploying the ML workflow, and integrating it with game backend components such as API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and GameLift FlexMatch. By following the steps, developers can automate data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment, ultimately enabling more balanced, fair, and engaging matchmaking experiences.\nBlog 2 - Tracing ETL Workloads using AWS X-Ray and AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry This blog explains how to add end-to-end observability to an ETL pipeline using AWS Glue, Step Functions, Lambda, AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry, and AWS X-Ray. When a dataset is uploaded to S3, a Lambda function starts a new trace, and this trace ID is passed through the entire workflow so both Glue jobs (data cleaning and data processing) appear as connected spans on X-Ray. ADOT instrumentation and an OpenTelemetry Collector sidecar send detailed sub-segment data from each transformation step, allowing engineers to see the entire pipeline flow, pinpoint failures, identify slow operations, and optimize performance. The article also shows how to deploy the architecture with AWS CDK, configure the collector, and clean up resources.\nBlog 3 - The AWS Imagine Grant launches the 2025 cycle in six countries, expanding its global reach This blog announces the launch of the 2025 AWS Imagine Grant cycle, now open to registered nonprofit organizations in six countries (US, UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) that are using cloud technology to accelerate their missions. It explains how the program supports nonprofits with unrestricted financial funding, AWS Promotional Credit, and technical guidance, especially for projects using advanced services like AI/ML, HPC, IoT, and generative AI.

Working Environment\nThe office atmosphere is friendly, comfortable, and easy to adjust to. FCAJ members are approachable and always willing to support me whenever I face challenges, even outside regular working hours. The workspace is clean, organized, and helps maintain good concentration and productivity.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nMy mentor provides clear explanations, structured guidance, and encourages me to think through problems independently instead of relying on direct answers. This helped me improve problem-solving skills. The admin team also works efficiently — handling paperwork, sharing needed information, and ensuring I have all required resources to complete my tasks.\n3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major\nThe work assigned closely matches my academic field while also introducing me to tools and concepts that go beyond the university curriculum. This combination strengthened my foundational knowledge and gave me practical, hands-on experience.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities\nDuring the internship, I learned how to use project management tools effectively, collaborate in a team environment, and communicate in a professional and structured way. My mentor also offered career insights that helped me better understand the skills and direction I should focus on for future development.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe team promotes a positive, respectful culture. Everyone works responsibly, supports each other, and still maintains an enjoyable atmosphere. This makes the workplace inviting and motivating.\n6. Internship Policies / Benefits\nThe company offers flexible working hours when needed, which helps with time management. Additionally, the chance to join internal tech sessions and workshops is a valuable benefit for interns seeking to expand their knowledge.\nAdditional Questions What did you find most satisfying during your internship?\nThe most satisfying part was how much I learned in such a short time. With combination of supportive guidance from my mentor, hands-on tasks, real project exposure, and opportunities to practice directly, I felt my skills improved significantly. I also felt that my work contributed meaningfully to the team.\nWhat do you think the company should improve for future interns?\nA weekly overview of office seat availability would be very helpful. It would allow interns to plan office days more proactively and avoid last-minute adjustments.\nIf recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?\nYes, I would. The working environment is supportive, the mentorship system is strong, and the tasks provide a balanced mix of learning new skills and applying academic knowledge. It’s a place where interns can grow confidently and contribute to real projects.\n"},{"uri":"https://domint1.github.io/FCJ-Internship-Report/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://domint1.github.io/FCJ-Internship-Report/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
